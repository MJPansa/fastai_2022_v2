# Easy conda setup for running SD notebooks/development locally 
### Steps:
- get and install conda (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads)
- download the `env.yaml` file from this repo
- go to your preferred terminal and run `conda env create -f env.yaml`
- activate the new environment by running `conda activate fastai_2022_v2`

For completeness: I am referring to running the Stable Diffusion notebooks from lesson 9 (https://github.com/fastai/diffusion-nbs)
REMINDER: When running the NBs make sure you have created an account at Huggingface (https://huggingface.co/) and that you have accepted the terms and conditions for using the SD model (https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4)
